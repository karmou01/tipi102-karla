#Problem: Running Sum

# Write a function running_sum() that accepts a list of integers superhero_stats
# representing the number of crimes Batman has stopped each month in Gotham City.
# The function should modify the list to return the running sum such that 
# superhero_stats[i] = sum(superhero_stats[0]...superhero_stats[i]). You must 
# modify the list in place; you may not create any new lists as part of your solution.

def running_sum(superhero_stats):
    
    for i in range(1, len(superhero_stats)):
        superhero_stats[i] = superhero_stats[i - 1] + superhero_stats[i]
    return superhero_stats

superhero_stats1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(running_sum(superhero_stats1))

superhero_stats2 = [3, 1, 2, 10, 1]
print(running_sum(superhero_stats2))
